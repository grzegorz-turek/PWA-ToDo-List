## 2. To run project locally:
- clone repository
- install dependencies: `yarn install` or `npm install` in root folder
- run in development mode: `yarn start` or `npm start` in root folder, app will automatically be browsed at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or
- run in production mode: `yarn build` or `npm run build` in `/client` folder: app will be build and bundled into `/client/build` folder so it is ready for deployment

## 3. Main technologies used in this app:
- create-react-app - for app frame creation
- MongoDB for data storage
- Express for API building
- Mongoose for data management
- React for UI building
- Redux for global state management

## 4. Still under development, planned updates include:
- multi-list feature (currently one list available only)
